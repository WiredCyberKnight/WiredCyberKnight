I'm currently focused on completing the Harvard CS50x course to gain a comprehensive understanding of computer science and programming languages. My goal is to enhance my skills in malware analysis by experimenting with malware in an isolated environment.

Additionally, I'm planning to develop a 3D website as part of my final project, possibly sooner depending on my progress week by week.

After completing CS50x, I intend to delve into network penetration testing and explore various pen testing tools. I'll be sharing these projects here as well.
